<h2>Books</h2>
<p>
My favorite books are the pulp fictions and crimes. I wouldn't say more about this, because lots of people know it. I'd like to explain an other interesting books.

<h3>Len Deighton: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fighter:_The_True_Story_of_the_Battle_of_Britain">Fighter: The True Story of the Battle of Britain</a></h3>
<p>
Deighton explains both the political and personal machinations and how they influenced technical decisions and affected the efforts of both countries. There are short biographies of the major "players", from the commanders down to the pilots in the field. It covers the errors made in the strategic, tactical and technical decisions made by both sides with remarkable objectivity.

<h3><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Sergeyevich_Yakovlev">Alexander Sergeyevich Yakovlev</a>: Notes of an Aircraft Designer</h3>
<p>
Yakovlev was chief designer of the Yakovlev Design Bureau and Vice-Minister of Aviation Industry during World War II. After filtering out the political allusions of the soviet era, we get an interesting book of the aviation history. There are a lot of stories of his life, for example about Yak airplanes,  Stalin, Messerschmitt, Ilyushin, Mikoyan, Heinkel.

<h3>Antonio Mu&#241;oz Molina: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Winter-Lisbon-Antonio-Munoz-Molina/dp/1862071667">Winter in Lisbon</a></h3>
<p>
This book is not a quick readable as my favorite books, but I enjoy it. I don't like the long sentences and paragraphs, but the talent writer can pack a whole paragraph into one short sentence.
