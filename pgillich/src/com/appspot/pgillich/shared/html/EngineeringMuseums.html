<h2>Museums</h2>
<p>Nowadays I've seen more technical museums.</p>
<dl>
<dt><a href="http://www.km.iif.hu/">Hungarian Museum of Transport, Budapest</a></dt>
<dd>The makings of this museum are good, but - unfortunately - not utilized. For example, the museum is not at all interactive. Let's see the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Navigation_light#Marine_navigation_lights">marine navigation lights</a>. More different navigation lights are exhibited, but there aren't any description or help what the matter are these subjects there. Why are exhibited? How it work? A simple computer simulation or a toy-like installation could present the essence of the marine navigation. It could be combined with the  exhibited radars. It's only one example...</dd>
<dt><a href="http://muzeum.kozut.hu">Exhibition of Road Collection, Kisk&#337;r&#246;s</a></dt>
<dd>I've been to there more times in my childhood. Since this time, the museum has been reconstructed. It has been become interactive (including the cafe shop, too). It seems a lot of money has spent for the reconstruction, but unfortunately no money for looking after the exhibited subjects.</dd>
