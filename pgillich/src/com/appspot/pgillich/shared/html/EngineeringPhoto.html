<p>I'm not a good photographer, but I'm interested in the technical details. I was a Minolta fan, but I must realize, my lens and bodies are unused. I sold all of them and bought a compact camera (<a href="http://www.kenrockwell.com/canon/compacts/g12.htm">Canon G12</a>) and a compact flash (<a href="http://www.kenrockwell.com/canon/flash/270ex.htm">Canon 270EX</a>). I hesitated weeks between Nikon P7000 and Canon G12. The P7000 has longer zoom, but I've read in the reviews the P7000 is slow. The picture write speed is not important for me, but the operational speed is important. For example, changing the ISO speed takes more seconds (!)</p>
