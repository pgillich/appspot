<h3>Antonio Munoz Molina: Winter in Lisbon</h3>
<p>
My favorite books are pulp fictions and crimes. I wouldn't say more about this, because lots of people know it.<br/>
I'd like to explain an other book: Winter in Lisbon. This book is not a quick readable as my favorite books, but I enjoy it. I don't like the long sentences and paragraphs, but the talent writer can pack a whole paragraph into one short sentence.
