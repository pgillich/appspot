<p>Some catastrophes from the (engineering) world...</p>
<h3>Eschede</h3>
<p>
It was began a management mistake (quick!), was continued by a a design mistake (DuoBlock for high-speed trains), was followed by a development quality mistake (skipped lifecycle test) and maintenance quality mistake (lazy fatigue crack handling).<br/>
Finally, a steel tire on a wheel broke at Eschede...<br/>

<h3>Fukushima</h3>
<p>
When I first heard in the news that we didn't have to afraid of missing cooling of the reactors, because an other reactor was hardly melted in same situation (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three_Mile_Island_accident">Three Mile Island</a>), I got panic.<br/>
At the three-mile-island disaster, a valve status was confused. After setting it manually, the cooling was solved. But the cooling system was totally destroyed at Fukushima!
