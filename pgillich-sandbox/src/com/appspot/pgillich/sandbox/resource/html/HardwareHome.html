<h2>Hardware at Home</h2>
<p>I hate noise.<br/>
My desktop has big fans running at low speed. The passive-cooling video card is integrated on the motherboard.</p>
<p>The WiFi router is a Netgear WGR614v8, which is able to run open source firmware, see: <a href="http://www.dd-wrt.com/wiki/index.php/Netgear_WGR614v8/L/WW">Netgear WGR614v8/L/WW</a>, but I didn't have enough time to install it.</p>
